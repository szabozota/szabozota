<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Zoltan</h1>
<h3 align="center">SMT Industrial Project Manager → Data Scientist | Manufacturing Optimization meets Machine Learning</h3>

Based in Hungary | Data Science MSc student (graduating June 2026)<br>
Open to data science and ML engineering opportunities in Veszprem county and remote

## About Me

I bring 8 years of industrial engineering experience at Valeo, where I've lead engineering teams, optimized production processes, and managed complex technical projects. Now I'm channeling that operational expertise into data science — building ML solutions that solve real business problems.

## Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python, SQL, C  
**ML/DL Frameworks:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
**NLP & Transformers:** Sentence-BERT, LSTM networks  
**Data Tools:** pandas, NumPy  

## Featured Projects

### [Master Data Deduplication System](link-to-repo) *In Progress*
*MSc Thesis Project | Entity Matching & Record Linkage*

Building an intelligent deduplication system for e-commerce product catalogs using entity matching techniques. Implementing multiple approaches from traditional TF-IDF to transformer-based models (Sentence-BERT, Cross-Encoders) with strategic blocking methods to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

- **Dataset:** Amazon-Walmart product matching (50K+ records)
- **Techniques:** NLP embeddings, cosine similarity, neural cross-encoders
- **Focus:** Production-ready blocking strategies for scalability
- **Status:** Active thesis research (completion June 2026)

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection with LSTM](link-to-repo) *In Progress*
*Deep Learning Course Project*

Developing a temporal fraud detection model using LSTM networks to identify fraudulent transactions in sequential credit card data. Tackling class imbalance and feature engineering challenges inherent in financial fraud detection.

- **Architecture:** Multi-layer LSTM
- **Tools:** Keras
- **Status:** Ongoing coursework project, refining model architecture and evaluation metrics

## Currently
- Completing Data Science MSc thesis on entity matching systems
- Exploring applications of transformers in data deduplication
- Building hands-on projects in NLP and deep learning
- Active job seeker for data science roles

## Beyond Code

When I'm not training models, I'm training my hands — cooking and sewing mostly. I've got a growing maker itch: an Arduino still in its box, plans for carpentry workshops, dreams of a 3D printer. There's something satisfying about being a craftsman in both digital and physical worlds, even if some of those worlds are still on the to-do list.
